## Abstract

Nowadays, patient self-management is encouraged in home-based healthcare, especially for chronic disease care. Sharing health information could improve the quality of patient self-management. In this paper, we introduce cloud computing as a potential technology to provide a more sustainable long-term solution compared with other technologies. A hybrid cloud is identified as a suitable way to enable patients to share health information for promoting the treatment of chronic diseases. And then a prototype on the case of type 2 diabetes is implemented to prove the feasibility of the proposed solution.
