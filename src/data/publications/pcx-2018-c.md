## Abstract

The vast amount of Web services brings the problem of discovering desired services for composition and orchestration. The syntactic service matching methods based on the classical set theory have a difficulty to capture the imprecise information. Therefore, an approximate service matching approach based on fuzzy control is explored in this paper. A service description matching model to the OpenAPI specification, which is the most widely used standard for describing the defacto REST Web services, is proposed to realize the fuzzy service matching with the fuzzy inference method developed by Mamdani and Assilian. An evaluation shows that the fuzzy service matching approach performed slightly better than the weighted approach in the setting context.
